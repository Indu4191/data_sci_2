    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Sentiment analysis is one of the most popular topics in NLP. Most commonly it is the quantification of text into valence and subjectivity scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "First we will load in a dataset of pre-coded sentiment scores for positivity and negativity on words. These words are also tagged with their part of speech in the sentence. We can use these valence scores to evaluate the sentiment of rottentomatoes movie reviews. Many packages such as TextBlob come pre-packaged with sentiment scores for words after parsing text, but doing the sentiment parsing manually will show you how it can be done without any \"magic\".\n",
    "\n",
    "We will also explore a more advanced sentiment analysis library in python: [VADER](https://github.com/cjhutto/vaderSentiment). We can parse the sentiment of the movie reviews using this package and compare it to our more basic method.\n",

    "## Load the word sentiment dataset\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Below we will load in some pre-tagged positive and negative valence scores for a dictionary of words. Each row of the dataset contains the part of speech, the word, the positive score, and the negative score for the word. A word may appear more than once if it can appear with different part of speech tags. \n",
    "\n",
    "These scores are designed so that we can also derive the *objectivity score* of the word from the positive and negative scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "Objectivity is calculated: \n",
    "\n",
    "    1. - (positive_score + negative_score)\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus if a score has zero positive score and negative score it is completely objective. If a score has, for example, 0.5 positive and 0.5 negative, it may not be any more positive than negative but we can tell that it is subjective (objectivity = 0.).\n"
